# What to Ask Your Website Company: Security & Ongoing Maintenance

## Why Website Security and Maintenance Matter

A website isn’t something you build once and forget about. It needs regular
maintenance to stay secure, function properly, and avoid costly downtime.
Many small business owners assume that once their site is live, their job is
done—but failing to maintain your website can lead to security breaches,
broken features, and even loss of business.

## Key Aspects of Website Security

### **1. SSL Certificates (HTTPS)**
- SSL encrypts data between your website and visitors, making it more secure.
- Google **prioritises** secure websites in search rankings.
- If your site doesn’t have SSL, visitors may see a **“Not Secure”** warning in their browser.

### **2. Regular Software Updates**
- Websites built on platforms like **WordPress** need frequent updates to prevent hacking.
- Plugins, themes, and core software must be kept up to date.

### **3. Strong Passwords & User Access Control**
- Weak passwords are a major security risk.
- Limit admin access to only those who **need** it.

### **4. Backups (Just in Case!)**
- Regular backups ensure that if something goes wrong, you can restore your site.
- Ideally, backups should be **automatic** and stored securely **off-site**.

### **5. Malware Protection & Monitoring**
- Some websites get hacked without owners realising.
- Security plugins or services can help monitor for suspicious activity.

## Key Aspects of Website Maintenance

Keeping your website in good shape means more than just security—it also
includes performance and functionality:

- **Checking for broken links** – Avoid frustrating visitors with dead links.
- **Ensuring forms and features work properly** – Contact forms, payment systems, and interactive elements must function as expected.
- **Updating content** – Outdated information can hurt credibility and SEO.
- **Checking speed and performance** – Slow sites drive visitors away.

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Before discussing security and maintenance with your web company, consider:

1. **Who will be responsible for keeping my website updated?**
2. **What happens if my website gets hacked or goes offline?**
3. **Do I need to update my own content, or will someone do it for me?**
4. **How important is uptime and security for my business?** (E-commerce sites, for example, need extra protection.)

## Questions to Ask Your Website Company

When hiring a web company, ask them:

1. **Will my website have an SSL certificate, and is it included in the cost?**
2. **How often do you update the website software, plugins, and security settings?**
3. **Will my website have automatic backups? Where are they stored?**
4. **What security measures do you implement to prevent hacking?**
5. **Do you offer ongoing maintenance services, and how much do they cost?**

## Avoiding "Set It and Forget It" Mistakes

Many business owners think security and maintenance are optional—but they’re
essential. A neglected website can lead to downtime, security breaches, or
poor performance, all of which can harm your business.

If your website company **doesn’t mention security or maintenance**, that’s a
red flag!

## Next Steps

Now that you know how to keep your website safe and running smoothly, it’s
time to think about **content and user experience (UX)**. A well-maintained
website is great, but if the content and design don’t engage visitors, you
won’t get results. Our next article will cover how to create a website
that’s easy to use and full of useful information.
