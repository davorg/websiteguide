# What to Ask Your Website Company: SEO & Performance

## Why SEO and Performance Matter

Having a website is pointless if no one can find it. Search Engine
Optimisation (SEO) helps your website appear in Google searches, while
performance ensures your site loads quickly and works well on all devices.

Many small business owners assume that just having a website means they’ll
start getting visitors. Unfortunately, that’s not the case—your site needs
to be **optimised** to show up in search results and load quickly enough
to keep visitors engaged.

## Key SEO Essentials for Your Website

Good SEO isn’t about tricking Google—it’s about making your website
**relevant and useful** to your audience. Here are some essential SEO factors:

### **1. Keyword Optimisation**
- Your website should include the words and phrases your customers search for.
- Example: If you’re a plumber in Manchester, your site should mention “plumber in Manchester” naturally in the content.

### **2. Mobile-Friendly Design**
- More than 50% of web traffic comes from mobile devices.
- Google ranks mobile-friendly sites higher.
- Your site should be easy to read and navigate on phones and tablets.

### **3. Page Speed**
- If your site takes more than **3 seconds** to load, visitors may leave.
- Factors affecting speed include hosting quality, image sizes, and unnecessary scripts.

### **4. Clear Site Structure**
- Google favours sites with clear navigation.
- Each page should have a clear **title**, relevant **headings**, and **internal links**.

### **5. Local SEO (For Local Businesses)**
- Ensure your business is listed on **Google Business Profile** (formerly Google My Business).
- Include your business name, address, and phone number **consistently** across the web.

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Before discussing SEO with your website company, consider:

1. **Who are my target customers, and what will they search for?**
2. **Is my business local, national, or international?** Local businesses need different SEO strategies.
3. **Do I plan to write blog posts or update content regularly?** Fresh content helps with SEO.
4. **How important is speed and mobile-friendliness to my audience?** (Hint: It’s very important!)

## Questions to Ask Your Website Company

When speaking to a web agency, ask them:

1. **How will you optimise my site for search engines?**
2. **Will my site be mobile-friendly and fast?**
3. **What tools do you use to track website traffic and SEO performance?** (Google Analytics, Search Console, etc.)
4. **Will you set up basic SEO features like page titles and descriptions?**
5. **Do you offer ongoing SEO support or advice?**

## Avoiding SEO Scams

Some companies promise to "get you to #1 on Google" for a fee. **Be
cautious!** SEO takes time, and no company can guarantee top rankings.
Instead, focus on long-term strategies like **quality content, site speed,
and local SEO**.

## Next Steps

Now that you know how to get visitors to your site, the next step is ensuring
**your website is secure and well-maintained**. A hacked or broken website
can damage your reputation and business. In the next article, we’ll cover
