## {{ page.description }}

Many small business owners get caught out by **unexpected costs, hidden fees,
or unclear ownership** when hiring a web company. Some discover too late that
they **don’t even own their own website**—it’s locked to a platform or agency,
making it difficult to move or update.

Understanding **what you’re paying for and who controls your website** is
crucial to avoid surprises down the line.

## Understanding Website Costs

Website pricing can vary widely depending on complexity, functionality, and
the provider. Here are the main cost factors to consider:

### **1. Upfront Costs (One-Time Fees)**

- **Website design & development** – The cost to build the site.
- **Domain name** – The website address (e.g., mybusiness.co.uk). Typically paid annually.
- **Hosting** – Where your website lives online. Some platforms include it, others require separate hosting.
- **SSL certificate** – Provides security (some hosts include it for free).

### **2. Ongoing Costs (Recurring Fees)**

- **Hosting fees** – Monthly or yearly, depending on provider.
- **Maintenance & updates** – Keeping software/plugins up to date.
- **Support & troubleshooting** – Some agencies offer this as a monthly service.
- **E-commerce fees** – Platforms like Shopify charge transaction fees.
- **Marketing & search engine optimisation tools** – If using premium plugins or services.

### **3. Additional Costs to Watch Out For**

- **Custom features** – Extra functionality (e.g., booking systems, membership areas) may cost more.
- **Stock images & content creation** – If the agency provides images or writes content, there may be extra fees.
- **Email hosting** – Some website packages don’t include professional email accounts.

## Who Owns Your Website?

### **1. Do You Own the Domain Name?**

- The domain should be registered in **your** name, not the web company’s.
- If they register it for you, make sure you have full access.

### **2. Can You Move Your Website?**

- Some platforms (like Wix, Squarespace) don’t allow you to migrate your site elsewhere.
- Custom-built websites on WordPress or similar platforms are usually **more portable**.

### **3. Do You Have Admin Access?**

- You should have **full access** to your website’s backend.
- Some companies restrict access so you have to pay them for every change.

### **4. What Happens if You Stop Paying?**

- Does your site get deleted, or can you keep it?
- Some agencies charge a fee to transfer the website to another provider.

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Before signing a contract, consider:

1. **What’s my total budget (including ongoing costs)?**
2. **Do I want to manage my own website, or will I need ongoing support?**
3. **Am I comfortable with the platform, or will I rely on a developer for changes?**
4. **What happens if I want to switch providers in the future?**

## Questions to Ask Your Website Company

1. **What’s included in the quoted price, and what’s extra?**
2. **Who owns the domain name and hosting account?**
3. **Will I have full admin access to my website?**
4. **Are there any ongoing costs I need to be aware of?**
5. **Can I move my website to another provider if needed?**

## Avoiding Common Mistakes

Many business owners regret their website deals because they:

- Didn’t read the **contract or terms of service** carefully.
- Assumed they **owned the website**, only to find out they didn’t.
- Were **locked into high ongoing costs** they didn’t expect.
- Chose a cheap deal that led to **poor support or hidden fees** later.
