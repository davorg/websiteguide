# What to Ask Your Website Company: Choosing the Right Platform

## Why the Platform Matters

One of the biggest decisions you'll make when getting a website built is
**which platform it will be built on**. The platform affects how easy it
is to update your site, how flexible it is, and how much it will cost in
the long run.

If you don’t choose wisely, you could end up with a website that’s
difficult to update, expensive to maintain, or completely unsuitable for
your business needs.

## Common Website Platforms

Here’s a quick overview of the most popular website platforms for small
businesses:

### **1. WordPress** (Most Popular)
- Best for: Businesses that need a flexible, customisable website.
- Pros: Huge range of plugins, good for SEO, can grow with your business.
- Cons: Needs regular maintenance, can be complex for beginners.

### **2. Shopify** (Best for E-commerce)
- Best for: Online stores selling products.
- Pros: Secure, easy to use, includes payment processing.
- Cons: Monthly fees, limited flexibility outside of e-commerce.

### **3. Wix & Squarespace** (Best for Simplicity)
- Best for: Businesses needing a simple, easy-to-maintain website.
- Pros: No coding required, drag-and-drop builder, includes hosting.
- Cons: Less flexibility, harder to scale if your business grows.

### **4. Custom-Built Websites**
- Best for: Businesses with very specific needs or high traffic.
- Pros: Fully tailored, can be optimised for performance and security.
- Cons: Expensive, requires a developer for updates.

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Before choosing a platform, consider these questions:

1. **Will I need to update the website myself?** If so, you’ll want something user-friendly.
2. **Do I need to sell products online?** If yes, e-commerce platforms like Shopify might be best.
3. **What’s my budget for setup and ongoing costs?** Some platforms have monthly fees, others require hosting and maintenance.
4. **Will I need advanced features in the future?** If your business will grow, choose a scalable platform.
5. **How important is SEO?** Some platforms (like WordPress) are better for search engine rankings than others.

## Questions to Ask Your Website Company

When speaking to a web company, ask them:

1. **Which platform do you recommend for my business, and why?**
2. **Will I be able to update the website myself? If so, how?**
3. **What are the ongoing costs for hosting, maintenance, or subscriptions?**
4. **Can I move my website to another provider in the future if needed?**
5. **What are the pros and cons of the platform you’re suggesting?**

## Avoiding Lock-In

Some web companies build sites on **proprietary platforms**, meaning you
can’t move your website elsewhere if you’re unhappy. Always ensure your
website is on a platform you can control and move if necessary.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a better idea of which platform might work best, the next
thing to consider is **how your website will be found online**. A
great-looking site is worthless if nobody visits it! In the next article,
