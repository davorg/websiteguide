# What to Ask Your Website Company: Defining Your Website Goals

## Why Every Website Needs a Clear Purpose

Before you even think about hiring a website company, you need to be clear
on **what you want your website to achieve**. Many small business owners rush
into getting a website built without a clear strategy, and the result is often
a site that looks nice but doesn’t actually help the business.

Your website is an investment, and like any investment, it should bring you
results. But what kind of results? That depends on your business goals.

## Common Website Goals for Small Businesses

Here are some common goals that small business websites should aim for:

- **Generating leads** – Encouraging potential customers to contact you.
- **Selling products or services** – Running an online shop.
- **Providing business information** – Helping people find your location, contact details, and opening hours.
- **Building trust and credibility** – Showcasing testimonials, case studies, and company information.
- **Educating customers** – Offering helpful content, blog posts, or FAQs.
- **Encouraging bookings or reservations** – If you run a service-based business.

The clearer you are on your website’s goals, the better your web company
can build something that meets your needs.

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Before speaking to a website company, take a few minutes to consider these
questions:

1. **What is the primary purpose of my website?** (Lead generation, sales, information, etc.)
2. **What action do I want visitors to take?** (Fill out a contact form, buy something, call me, etc.)
3. **Who is my target audience?** (Age, location, interests, online behaviour.)
4. **How will I measure success?** (More enquiries, increased sales, better brand recognition.)
5. **What content do I need?** (Do I already have text and images, or do I need help creating them?)

## Questions to Ask Your Website Company

Once you know what you want from your website, you can ask potential website
providers the right questions:

1. **How will you design the site to help achieve my goals?**
2. **What features do you recommend based on my business type?**
3. **Can you provide examples of websites you've built for similar businesses?**
4. **How will the website encourage visitors to take action?**
5. **Can you help with content, or do I need to provide everything myself?**

## Avoiding the "Looks Nice but Does Nothing" Trap

A common mistake is focusing too much on appearance and not enough on
functionality. A visually stunning website is **useless** if it doesn’t
convert visitors into customers. Make sure your website is designed with a
**clear purpose and user journey** in mind.

## Next Steps

Once you’re clear on your goals, the next step is choosing the right
**platform** for your website. Some businesses need a simple website they can
update themselves, while others require an advanced e-commerce solution.
