## {{ page.description: }}

Not all website companies are created equal. Some provide excellent service,
while others **overcharge, underdeliver, or lock you into restrictive
contracts**. Many small business owners have been burned by web companies
that disappear, deliver subpar work, or make it difficult to update or move
their website.

Knowing the warning signs **before** you commit can save you time, money, and
frustration.

## Red Flags to Watch Out For

### **1. No Clear Pricing or Hidden Fees**

- They can’t give a **straight answer** about costs.
- They offer a very cheap starting price but have **hidden add-ons** for basic features.
- They insist on **long-term contracts** with **no clear way to exit**.

### **2. You Don’t Own Your Website**

- They **register the domain name in their name, not yours**.
- Your website is locked into **their custom system**, making it impossible to move.
- They refuse to give you **admin access**.

### **3. Poor Communication & Support**

- Slow to reply to emails or messages.
- No clear process for support or maintenance after launch.
- No documentation or training on how to use your website.

### **4. No Portfolio or Real Client Reviews**

- They can’t show **previous work** or only show **generic templates**.
- Reviews seem **fake or overly generic**.
- No **case studies** or references from real businesses.

### **5. They Guarantee You’ll Be “#1 on Google”**

- No one can guarantee top rankings on Google.
- SEO takes time, and any company promising **instant results** is likely using **spammy techniques** that could get your site penalised.

### **6. No Security or Maintenance Plan**

- They don’t mention **SSL certificates, backups, or security updates**.
- No plan for keeping your website **updated and secure**.

### **7. They Won’t Explain Things Clearly**

- They use **too much jargon** and avoid answering basic questions.
- They make you feel **stupid for asking questions**.
- A good web company should explain things in **plain English**.

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Before signing a contract, consider:

1. **Do I feel comfortable with their level of communication and transparency?**
2. **Have I checked their previous work and reviews?**
3. **Do I fully understand what I’m paying for?**
4. **If I need to move my website elsewhere, can I?**

## Questions to Ask Your Website Company

1. **Can I see examples of websites you’ve built for businesses like mine?**
2. **Who owns the website and domain name once it’s built?**
3. **What happens if I need support after launch?**
4. **Are there any hidden fees or ongoing costs?**
5. **How do you handle security and updates?**

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

Many businesses regret their website choice because they:

- Chose the **cheapest option** without checking the details.
- Didn’t read the **contract** before signing.
- Assumed **they owned the website**, only to find out they didn’t.
- Got **stuck with a bad provider** and couldn’t easily switch.

A reputable website company should be **honest, transparent, and helpful**.
If something feels off, **trust your instincts** and look for a better option.
