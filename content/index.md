# What to Ask Your Website Company: Content & User Experience (UX)

## Why Content and UX Matter

A beautiful website is useless if visitors can’t find what they need ori
don’t understand your message. Your website’s **content** (text, images,
videos) and **user experience (UX)** (how easy it is to navigate and use)
are crucial for converting visitors into customers.

Many small business owners focus too much on looks and not enough on
**clarity and usability**. A good website should be **easy to read, simple
to navigate, and designed with your audience in mind.**

## Key Aspects of Content

### **1. Clear, Concise Messaging**
- Visitors should instantly understand **who you are and what you offer**.
- Avoid jargon—write as if you’re explaining to a customer in person.
- Use **headings and bullet points** to break up text and make it scannable.

### **2. Calls to Action (CTAs)**
- Every page should guide visitors to take **action** (e.g., "Call us", "Get a quote", "Buy now").
- Make CTAs **visible, clear, and easy to click.**

### **3. High-Quality Images & Branding**
- Use professional images that reflect your business.
- Avoid generic stock photos—customers prefer **real, authentic images.**
- Ensure images are **optimised for fast loading** (large files slow down websites).

### **4. Trust Signals**
- Display **testimonials, case studies, awards, and client logos** to build trust.
- If you’re selling online, include **secure payment badges**.

### **5. SEO-Friendly Content**
- Use relevant keywords naturally in your content.
- Each page should have a unique **title and meta description** to help Google understand your site.

## Key Aspects of User Experience (UX)

### **1. Simple, Logical Navigation**
- Visitors should find what they need in **3 clicks or fewer**.
- Keep menus clear and simple—avoid too many options.
- Important pages (Contact, Services, Shop) should be easy to find.

### **2. Mobile-Friendly Design**
- Your site must work well on **phones and tablets**.
- Text should be readable without zooming.
- Buttons and links should be **easy to tap**.

### **3. Fast Load Speed**
- Slow websites lose visitors.
- Optimise images, use fast hosting, and limit unnecessary features.

### **4. Accessibility for All Users**
- Follow accessibility best practices (e.g., **alt text for images, readable fonts, colour contrast**).
- Make sure users with disabilities can navigate your site easily.

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Before discussing content and UX with your website company, consider:

1. **What key information must be on my website?** (Services, pricing, testimonials, etc.)
2. **What action do I want visitors to take?** (Call me, book an appointment, make a purchase?)
3. **Do I have high-quality images and written content, or do I need help creating them?**
4. **Does my target audience browse on mobile, desktop, or both?**

## Questions to Ask Your Website Company

1. **Will you help with content, or do I need to provide everything myself?**
2. **How will you ensure the site is easy to navigate?**
3. **Will the website be fully mobile-friendly?**
4. **Can you optimise images and pages for fast loading?**
5. **How will you make sure the site is accessible to all users?**

## Avoiding Common Mistakes

Many websites fail because they:
- Use **too much text**—people skim, they don’t read!
- Have no **clear call to action**, leaving visitors unsure what to do next.
- Are **cluttered or confusing**, making people give up and leave.

A simple, well-structured site **with clear messaging and easy navigation**
will always perform better than a flashy but confusing one.

## Next Steps

Now that you know how to structure your content and UX, the next step is
ensuring your website works **for e-commerce or service bookings** (if
relevant). If you’re planning to sell online or allow customers to book
appointments, you need to get the right systems in place.
